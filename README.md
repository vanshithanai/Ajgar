This is a repo created to do save some basic python projects.

All my python experiments are saved here for posterity.
1. *Encoder_Decoder.py* - Will take an input string and encode or decode depending on the input.

More details about each project will be posted when work is completed.
Many small python projects will be added here for reference.
