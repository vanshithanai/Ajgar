This is a repo created to do save some basic python projects.

All my python experiments are saved here for posterity.
1. *Encoder_Decoder.py* - Will take an input string and encode or decode depending on the input.

2. *Palindrome* - Checks if the word entered is a palindrome or not. If it is not, converts it into one.

3. *Temperature Convert* - Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa.

4. *List_sort* - Takes numbers as input from the user and arranges them into ascending or descending order, as instructed.

5. *LCM* - Finds LCM of the 2 numbers entered.

6. *FloorSqrt* - Finds the Square Root of the given number and rounds it down to the nearest integer.

7. *LCMmany* - Find LCM of more than 2 numbers.

8. *SentenceUnshuffle* - Given a shuffled sentence, reconstruct and return the original sentence with numbers at the end of each word indicating its position.

9. *text_to_speech* - Converts a given text to speech output. The speech output is fine, but the `save_to_file()` output is empty and hangs after the 3rd attempt.



More details about each project will be posted when work is completed.
Many small python projects will be added here for reference.
