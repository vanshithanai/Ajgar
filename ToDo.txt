To Do:

DONE:
1. Create a suitable Decoder - Just flip the encoder dict to make a decoder dict.
2. Create a main function which will accept - 
    a. Whether to Encode or Decode
    b. The string to encode/decode
3. Create separate encoding() and decoding() functions and call those functions from main()
4. Create a class with a constructor which will have the encoder/decoder dict as a private variable.
5. The dict should be loaded from an external JSON file.
6. Error handling using Try...Except
